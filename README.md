# NodeJS Post Tester

### Purpose

The entire point of using this for myself is to have a local port to send quick post requests to.

My JSON will simply conform to what I'm posting, so I can confirm the post requests are working properly.

### Why NodeJS

I could use Vapor or Go, but I've always had a very easy time building a very quick get/post request with Node instead.

It's not my default solution in a production state, but it is a solution to quickly try a post request.
